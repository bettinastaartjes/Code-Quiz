# Code-Quiz

# User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

# Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

# TUTORING HELP
I was able to figure out how to set up the quiz questions, submit button, reload the quiz.
Need help figuring out the following...
    - Setting up the initial home quiz box (before the questions load)
    - How to reload the timer for each question
    - Telling the user whether the question was wrong and then time subtracting from the clock
    - Saving initials and score (high scores html page)
