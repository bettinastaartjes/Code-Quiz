# Assignment Summary

Though I will be requesting tutoring for this, this is the home page of my quiz. To get a 100 on this assignment, I need to create another home page for the quiz featuring a "start" button that activates the timer and questions.

When you answer a question, a correct/incorrect prompt appears below. If it's incorrect, time is deducted from the timer.

At the end of the quiz, you can enter your initials, view high scores, and reload the quiz.

# TUTORING HELP
I was able to figure out how to set up the quiz questions,  submit button, reload the quiz.
Need help figuring out the following...
    - Setting up the initial home quiz box (before the questions load)
    - Saving initials and score (high scores html page)
